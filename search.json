    "text": "★★★★★\n“Elizabeth Donaldson helped us find our dream home. This was no easy task given the market swing and low inventory. Elizabeth’s diligence and persistence in helping my family and I find a home off market was nothing short of a miracle, but Elizabeth made it happen with the greatest of ease. Elizabth kept us updated almost daily on market happening and new listings. Her knowledge of the market, connections, contacts, and rapport with other agents makes Elizabeth truly an asset to any buyer or seller for purchases and sales in any price range. In the same week Elizabeth closed on our dream home, she was able to help a very close family friend purchase a beautiful waterfront condo. Given the two sales in such close proximity, Elizabeth delivered remarkable results, service, and held our hand through the entire process, which can be extremely stressful. I strongly recommend Elizabeth Donaldson for all of your real estate needs.\n\nPatrick, Buyer | Mercer Island\n\n★★★★★\n“We worked with Elizabeth over a period of 6 months to find our dream home and were very impressed with her as our realtor throughout this time. She understood what we were looking for very early on, helped coordinate tours (very flexible with her hours), was informative on our queries, not pushy at all, and was super responsive to our requests. She went above and beyond to help us close on our house under some pretty challenging and unique circumstances and we very much appreciate that! Its’ hard to find realtors who are so client focused and we’d strongly recommend her for anyone looking to buy in the greater Seattle region.”\n\nRahul and Sanghmitra, Buyers | Woodinville\n\n★★★★★\n“When we decided to sell our house last year, we were unbelievably lucky to have chosen Elizabeth Donaldson to represent us. Elizabeth is a true professional, and she helped us navigate the complex set of steps necessary to realize the full potential of our home, generate the best interest in it, and ultimately maximize the selling price. We suspected our house needed a few upgrades prior to selling, and Elizabeth had great advice about which ones were truly necessary and which ones were less important to potential buyers. She even had advice on the addition of some fixtures to the interior, and landscaping choices. When it came time to schedule the work, Elizabeth provided us with leads on contractors and vendors as well as on creative financing options for the work that minimized our out-of-pocket costs. Her recommendations were top-notch, and she was instrumental in ensuring that all of the work actually got done on time and at a very high quality bar.\nWe chose to have our house staged, and Elizabeth provided us with excellent leads on staging companies. The stager we chose did a great job of presenting our house in a way that appealed to multiple types of buyers. Elizabeth’s marketing materials and approach to presenting the house online were amazing, and her chosen photographer took pictures so good that it made us want to make an offer on the house–they reflected the essence of our home so well. She held open houses that resulted in lots of great feedback and, ultimately, an offer we could not (and did not want to) refuse!\nWe have bought sold properties in the past, and one thing that sets Elizabeth apart from other agents we have worked with is her communications style. She provided us real-time updates on the progress of the work, the schedule of going-to-market, and the changing market conditions. She continuously solicited feedback from us and used that to help create a schedule for the sale. In negotiations with potential buyers, she handled the negotiations masterfully and gave us great advice on where to draw the line. She guided us through the maze of paperwork necessary to complete the transaction with very clear instructions and helped us stay on track with dates as we approached closing. She was super-responsive on the phone, and through text and e-mail; sometimes checking back with us multiple times per day. By the time we had agreed on a sale price with the buyers that met our target price, Elizabeth already had all documents lined up and ready to go. No step was missed, and the house closed without a hitch. We are very grateful to have had Elizabeth represent us in the sale of our house, and we would not hesitate to recommend her to anyone looking to buy or sell a property.\n\nDoug and Pinar, Sellers | Queen Anne\n\n★★★★★\n“Elizabeth was a dream in helping us navigate the search and purchase of a log home on acreage this past year. Our dream parameters were both wide and specific, and she graciously helped us explore various locations, narrow our search, and ultimately find the perfect log home getaway on Camano Island. The purchase of a log home came with many unforeseen questions and complications. Elizabeth was a true professional through the whole process. She was honest when she didn’t know an answer to a question about this unique style of home, and went above and beyond to research and help us get the answers we needed. She brought an eye for detail, and asked additional questions when she had a concern. She advocated for us as buyers, and swiftly assisted in finding area experts to perform additional inspections so that we would feel comfortable with our purchase. We are so thankful that we were able to work with Elizabeth and would (and have) recommended her without any hesitation for any real estate transaction. Friends who followed our advice fully agreed!\n\nRichie and Chantel, Buyers | Camano Island"
